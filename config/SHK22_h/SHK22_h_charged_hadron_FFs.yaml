  architecture: [1, 20, 7]

  # The output function can be either the activation function of the
  # NN (0), or linear (1), or quadratic (2). If this entry is absent a
  # linear function is assumed.
  output function: 2

  # The flavour map gives the the specific combinations of
  # distributions in the physical-basis (d, u, s, ..) to be fitted to
  # the data. The number of combinations has to match the number of
  # nodes of the output layer of the NN given in the
  # architecture. When defining the flavour map, one should keep in
  # mind that the code computes predictions using the QCD-evolution
  # basis (Sigma, V, T3, ...). Therefore, in general,
  # QCD-evolution-like combinations should be preferred. Moreover, the
  # distributions are assumed to be for the positive charge of the a
  # given hadronic species. The negative distributions are derived
  # using charge conjugation (q->qbar).
